SockJS Message Queue Server
===========================

A SockJS server for forwarding bitjws messages from a queue. Should not
care about contents of the message, which may come from more than one
publisher. Should be aware of Users and permissions, and only allow
subscription to data that the User has permission to read.

This server is meant to be used in coordination with one or more
flask-bitjws server(s) handling HTTP.

AMQP
----

The chosen message queue for sockjs-mq-server is
`AMQP <http://www.amqp.org/>`__, using the `pika
client <http://pika.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`__.

bitjws
------

Uses `bitjws <https://github.com/deginner/bitjws>`__ message signing for
authentication.

Running
-------

This project has two processes that need to be run: a sockjs server, and
a pika consumer. These can be run like so:

``python sockjs_pika_consumer.py``

``python sockjs_server.py``

It is advised to set up a supervisor for these processes. These are
expected to be running before you run the unit tests.
